About Your GRE® Score Report

Score Reporting Policies

Date of Birth: March 21, 1996

With the ScoreSelect® option, you can decide which test scores to send to the institutions you designate. There are three options to choose
from:

¢« Most Recent option — Send your scores from your most recent test administration
¢ — All option — Send your scores from all administrations in the last five years

¢« — Any option — Send your scores from one OR as many test administrations in the last five years (this option is not available on test
day when you select up to four FREE score reports)

Scores for a test administration must be reported in their entirety. Institutions will receive score reports that show only the scores that you
selected to send to them. There will be no special indication if you have taken additional GRE tests. See the GRE® Information Bulletin for
details. The policies and procedures explained in the Bulletin for the current testing year supersede previous policies and procedures in
previous bulletins.

Scores will be sent to designated score recipients approximately 10-15 days after a computer-delivered test and 5 weeks after a paper-
delivered test. If your scores are not available for any reason, you will see “Not Available” in Your Test Score History.

GRE test scores are reportable according to the following policies:

¢ For tests taken prior to July 1, 2016, scores are reportable for five (5) years following the testing year in which you tested (July 1 —
June 30). For example, scores for a test taken on May 15, 2015, are reportable through June 30, 2020. GRE scores earned prior to
August 2011 are no longer reportable.

¢ For tests taken on or after July 1, 2016, scores are reportable for five (5) years following your test date. For example, scores for a
test taken on July 3, 2016, are reportable through July 2, 2021.

Note: Score recipients will only receive scores from test administrations that you have selected to send to them.

Percentile Rank (% Below)

A percentile rank for a test score indicates the percentage of test takers who took that test and received a lower score. Regardless of when
the reported scores were earned, the percentile ranks for General Test and Subject Test scores are based on the scores of all test takers
who tested within the most recent three-year period.

Retaking a GRE Test

You can take the GRE® General Test once every 21 days, up to five times within any continuous rolling 12-month period (365 days). This
applies even if you canceled your scores on a test taken previously. You can take the paper-delivered GRE General Test and GRE® Subject
Tests as often as they are offered.

Note: This policy will be enforced even if a violation is not immediately identified (e.g., inconsistent registration information) and test scores
have been reported. In such cases, the invalid scores will be canceled and score recipients will be notified of the cancellation. Test fees will
be forfeited.
